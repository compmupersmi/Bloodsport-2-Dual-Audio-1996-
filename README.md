# Bloodsport 2 Dual Audio (1996): A Martial Arts Classic with Two Languages
     
If you are a fan of martial arts movies, you might have heard of **Bloodsport**, the 1988 film that launched the career of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The movie was based on the allegedly true story of Frank Dux, an American martial artist who participated in a secret and illegal tournament called the Kumite. The film was a huge success and spawned several sequels, but none of them featured Van Damme or Dux.
     
One of the sequels, however, is worth watching for a different reason. **Bloodsport 2**, released in 1996, stars Daniel Bernhardt as Alex Cardo, a thief who is imprisoned in Thailand and trained by a master named Sun (James Hong) to compete in the Kumite. The film follows the same formula as the original, with Cardo facing various opponents from different styles and countries, until he reaches the final showdown with the evil champion Demon (Ong Soo Han).

What makes this film unique is that it has a rare and hard-to-find version that features both English and German audio tracks. It also has a runtime of 116 minutes, which is longer than the original version that was released in the US. This version is known as **Bloodsport 2 Dual Audio 1996 116**, and it is a gem for martial arts fans who want to enjoy the film in two languages.
     
The dual audio feature allows the viewers to switch between English and German at any point in the film, or to watch it with both languages simultaneously. The German audio track is not a dub, but rather the original voice of the actors, since most of them were German or spoke German fluently. For example, Bernhardt, who is Swiss, speaks both English and German in the film, while Hong, who is American, speaks only English. The dual audio feature also adds some interesting nuances to the dialogue, such as when Cardo insults Demon in German, or when Sun teaches Cardo some Thai phrases in English.
     
The longer runtime of 116 minutes also adds some extra scenes and details that were cut from the US version. For example, there is a scene where Cardo meets his love interest Janine (Lori Lynn Dickson) at a bar and they dance together. There is also a scene where Cardo visits Sun's temple and learns more about his philosophy and history. These scenes help to develop the characters and the story better than the shorter version.
